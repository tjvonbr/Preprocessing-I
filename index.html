    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <p>Hello!  My name is Trevor Von Bruenchenhein, and I'm an aspiring full stack web developer.  I was born and raised in the northwest suburbs of Chicago, Illinois.  I attended Illinois State University from 2010 and 2014 and graduated with a degree in History Education.  Before beginning my journey with Lambda School, I taught high school history and politics for five years at the laboratory school for Illinois State University.  Around a year ago, I decided to pursue web development full time and was accepted into Lambda School's Web21 cohort which began in May of this year.</p>

    <p>In addition to the hours spent in front of my computer, I still enjoy reading widely--history, politics, economic, and some science-fiction--with whatever time I have leftover at the end of the day.  For the past year and a half, I have been training for Ironman race, but decided to put that adventure on hold until I complete the Lambda School program.  But I try to get out and run, cycle, or swim as often as I can.</p>
